# PixelPlant

## Makes plants, with pixels (and math)!
This is a simple project I made for the itch.io [Tool Jam 2](https://itch.io/jam/the-tool-jam-2).
The UI is very much in-development as I've never written anything in JavaScript (or TypeScript).
I have a lot of ideas for the future of this project and I'm excited to implement some of the following:
- A functional UI and alphabet editor
- Import and export
- Seedable RNG
- Maybe some fun with genetics in the future?
